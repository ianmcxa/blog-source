 These are some of the projects I've done over the years.

## [LearnSteno](https://learnsteno.mcxa.org)

 LearnSteno is a project to create a modern platform for learning [stenotype](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenotype) with [plover](http://www.openstenoproject.org/). The project consists of practice drills and lessons. Learnsteno is written in VueJS.

## [Vortaro](https://github.com/ianmcxa/vortaro)

Vortaro is an English-Esperanto dictionary app for Android. It is heavily inspired by the webpage [Tuja Voratro](https://www.tujavortaro.net/). It's really cool because it lets you search for both English or Esperanto words in a single text box. You can find the app on F-droid or on Google Play.

## [Zephyr Logger](https://github.com/ianmcxa/ZephyrLogger)

Developed as a research project at NC State University, Zephyr Logger takes raw heart rate data collected from the [Zephyr](https://www.zephyranywhere.com/resources/hxm) heart rate monitor. It's really cool because you can get quite a lot of interesting metrics out of precise heart rate data. At NC State we were attempting to use the data to measure stress.

I found this project unmaintained and updated it to support newer versions of Android and provide cleaner data. I also reworked the UI.

## [memearchive.org](https://memearchive.org)

A very silly project parodying archive.org. Memearchive seeks to preserve transcribed memes as sites go offline and image based memes become difficult to find with search engines. So, please upload and transcribe your memes. We must preserve our culture for future generations. 

Memearchive.org was written in Python and Flask. The image hosting is handled by a very cool little project called [minio](https://minio.io).

## [CitationScribe](https://ianmcxa.github.io/citationscribe)

A very simple html citation generator I made back in college. The code quality is not very good because I was learning javascript at the time. Actually, I think I wrote most of this in a single day during finals my freshman year of college, which also explains some things.
